## About Me 💚

Hi! I'm **Cindi**, a game design student deeply passionate about storytelling, emergent narratives, and how artificial intelligence can expand the boundaries of interactivity and immersion.  

Currently, I'm working on my **thesis**, exploring the intersection of **narrative design and AI** — crafting experiences where player choice meets intelligent systems.

In past lives (that I still love), I’ve worked as a **2D/3D artist**, **screenwriter**, and **illustrator**. Also: addicted to tea 🍵 and best friends with an orange cat named Ahsoka 🧡.
