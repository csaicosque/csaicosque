# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cindi, and I'm (trying) to be a game designer.
I'm a soon-to-be published writer and writing is the thing that I love the most.
I love to create stories and worlds, and seeing how happy or intrigued or shocked people get with my stories is the best sensation in the whole world.
I'm also a movie writer, director and actress (since 2020). I've written and directed two movies and acted in another two different movies. 

Recently I've started looking for new ways to create more immersive stories.
I'm studying for my Game Development degree and I'll graduate on August 2025.
I started learning Python in August 2022 at university and I
fell in love with programming, something I never thought I'd do.

I also enjoy artificial intelligence and virtual reality.

I speak native Portuguese, intermediary English, limited Spanish and a little bit of french, _je ne pratique pas_.

Fun fact: I love Red Dead Redemption 2, that's the game that made me love games and want to be a game designer.
